# Project 2 â€“ MIPS Assembler 


Due date: November 13, Sunday 23:55
In this project, you are going to implement an assembler for MIPS. You are given
an assembler (1) written in C++. However, this assembler has missing
instructions specified below. Your goal is to implement them in addition to several
pseudo-instructions.
Missing instructions: add, addi, lbu, lhu, ll, slt, slti, sb, sc, sh, sub
Pseudo-instructions: li, move, blt, ble
